The automated tests in this project do not include date calendar editor JavaScript popup. 
Therefore, when you touch dateCalendarEditor.js, dateCalendarEditor.jsp, dateTimeCombinedCalenadr.jsp,
dateTimeSeparatedCalendar.jsp, the part of date filtering in list.jsp or the method openxava.listenChanges
of openxava.js you have to test it visually at least the next cases:

Use any entity with a date (not the first focusable field) in detail mode. Like Order. 

- "Data changed" message on going list mode:
	- Lose the focus of date, without change it, then go to list. No message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select the current date, then go to list. No message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select any date, then go to list. A message shown.
- @OnChage: Add an @OnChange(OnChangeVoidAction.class) action to a date property.	
	- Lose the focus of date, without change it. @OnChange action not executed.
	- Use the dialog to select the current date. @OnChange action not executed.
	- Use the dialog to select any date. @OnChange action executed, one time.
	- Select a different date using the dialog (it will execute the action), 
		then enter and lose the focus of the date, it does not execute the action.
